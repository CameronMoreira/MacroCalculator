# MacroCalculator
This repo performs 2 things. It first has a Macro Calculator to find out what macronutrients one would need given their goals and body size.  The second is the DREE. Daily Resting Energy Expenditure. 

All of the calculations are based off of the Mifflin-St Jeor formula. It is very popular and a respected macro formula used to calculate REE.
